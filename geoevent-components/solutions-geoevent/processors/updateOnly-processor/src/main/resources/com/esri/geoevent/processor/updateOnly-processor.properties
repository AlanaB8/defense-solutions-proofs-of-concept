DESCRIPTION=Release ${project.release}: Keeps track of the latest TIME_START for each TRACK_ID in the events. If an event arrives with a TIME_START that is before (earlier) or equal to the cached TIME_START for that TRACK_ID, the event is discarded. If the TIME_START is after (later) the cached TIME_START for the event's TRACK_ID then the event is allowed to pass through (and the TIME_START is cached for that TRACK_ID).
